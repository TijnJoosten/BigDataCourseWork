This repository contains all the depository I had to make for the course 'Big Data'.
For the course, I had to make multiple assignments and one final project regarding big data.
The main topics where about the use of Spark and Scala and how they could be used to manage and analyse large amount of data.
All the work was tracked by creating blogposts on GitHub Pages.

The blog can be found [here](https://rubigdata.github.io/bigdata-blog-2021-TijnJoosten/), that is as long as the university keeps the page online.
This is also why I created this repository, as there is no certainty in the project being kept alive.
